Hello,
im realizing after completing this assignment that i forgot to commit my code. i was saving and not realizing what i was doing.
road to becoming a great coder.
Here is my quiz. i was struggling to make mine look exactly like the example but im happy that i was able to make slides appear. i had a 
tough time with the time. linking the clock to the actual quiz to start is something i cannot figure out. Also local storage is causing my trouble.
